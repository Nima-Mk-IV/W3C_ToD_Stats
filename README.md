# ToD's team distribution

This was quickly created to analyse the statistics of the distribution of the different races on ToD's 4v4 team versus the enemy's team. This scrapes its data from https://w3champions.com/ using selenium.

### The Theory:

In Warcraft III we have 4 playable races plus the ability to que into a game as random which means you will be assigned a race at the games start with (hopefully) equal probability. Now if we assume that there is a perfectly even race and random distribution (which we know is not true) we expect:
- 20% Human
- 20% Orc
- 20% Nightelf
- 20% Undead
- 20% Random
  - 25% Human
  - 25% Orc
  - 25% Nightelf
  - 25% Undead 
Under this ussumption we have an expected value of 1.75 humans on ToD's team and 1 human on the enemy team.
